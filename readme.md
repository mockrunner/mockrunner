Mockrunner - mock classes for enterprise application testing
============================================================

FYI: Older 1.1.x branch with support for Java 6 has been moved to "Best Effort" support as we prepare to update for Java 8. If you need support on a feature with that version, feel free to open an issue and we will try to address it as time allows, but our primary focus will be on updating for newer specs on Java 8/9.
